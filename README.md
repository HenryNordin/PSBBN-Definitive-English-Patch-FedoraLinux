# PSBBN Definitive English Patch

This is the definitive English patch for Sony's "PlayStation Broadband Navigator" software (also known as BB Navigator or PSBBN) for the "PlayStation 2" (PS2) video game console.

You can find out more about the PSBBN software on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Broadband_Navigator).

# Donations  
This project uses [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to automatically contribute game artwork and report missing artwork to the [PSBBN Art Database](https://github.com/CosmicScale/psbbn-art-database). I’m currently on a free account, which provides a temporary URL for seven days or 100 requests. As the project grows in popularity, we're exceeding the 100-request limit every few days. A paid subscription costs $9/month or $90/year, donations would help fund this.

If you appreciate my work and want to support the ongoing development of the PSBBN Definitive English Patch and other PS2-related projects, [you can donate to my Ko-Fi here](https://ko-fi.com/cosmicscale).

Manual submissions are welcome, see the [PSBBN art database GitHub page](https://github.com/CosmicScale/psbbn-art-database) for details

## New installation scripts

These scripts are essential for unlocking all the new features exclusive to version 2.0. They require a Linux environment to run. If Linux is not installed on your PC, you can use a live Linux environment on a bootable USB drive or a virtual machine. Debian-based distributions using `apt`, Arch-based distributions using `pacman`, and Fedora-based distributions using `dnf` are supported. You will require a HDD/SSD for your PS2 that is larger than 200 GB, ideally 500 GB or larger. I highly recommend a SSD for better performance. You can connect the HDD/SSD to your PC either directly via SATA or using a USB adapter.

## Video Tutorial:

[![PSBBN Definitive English Patch 2.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d60dc4ff-85f8-4fb4-8acb-201b063545b0)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHz0yKYybhk)

### It is highly recommended to install the scripts using the following command to enable automatic updates:
```
git clone https://github.com/CosmicScale/PSBBN-Definitive-English-Patch.git
```

### Setup script:
`01-Setup.sh` installs all the necessary dependencies for the other scripts and must be run first.

### PSBBN installer script:
`02-PSBBN-Installer.sh` fully automates the installation of PSBBN

- Downloads and installs the latest version of the **PSBBN Definitive English Patch** from archive.org
- Prompts for the desired size of the Music Partition
- Prompts for the desired size of the POPS Partition
- Installs a pre-release build of [Open PS2 Loader (OPL)](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader) with exFAT and Auto Launch support for BDM devices
- Installs [POPStarter](https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/Home)
- Runs [APA-Jail](#notes-on-apa-jail), creating an exFAT partition using all remaining disk space beyond the first 128 GB

### Game installer script: 
`03-Game-Installer.sh` fully automates the installation of PS1 and PS2 games. In the `games` folder on your computer, simply put your PS2 `ISO` or `ZSO` files in the `CD`/`DVD` folders, and your PS1 `VCD` files in the `POPS` folder.

The script will:
- Synchronise the games on your PC with your PS2's drive
- Create all game assets
- Download artwork from the [PSBBN Art Database](https://github.com/CosmicScale/psbbn-art-database) or IGN if not found in the database
- Automatically contribute game artwork from IGN and reports missing artwork to the [PSBBN Art Database](https://github.com/CosmicScale/psbbn-art-database)
- Install [OPL Launcher BDM](https://github.com/CosmicScale/OPL-Launcher-BDM) into every game partition, making games bootable from the Game Channel

To add or delete games, simply add or remove them from the `games` folder on your computer, then run the script again to synchronise. All games are kept in alphabetical order and grouped by series in the Game Channel on PSBBN.

By default the `games` folder is located in the same directory you installed the scrips to. If you need to change the location of the `games` folder, edit `03-Game-Installer.sh` and modify the `GAMES_PATH` variable.


### General Notes:
- PSBBN requires a Fat PS2 console** with expansion bay and an official Sony Network Adapter
- I would highly recommend using a **Kaico IDE to SATA Upgrade Kit** and a SATA SSD. The improved random access speed over a HDD really makes a big difference to the responsiveness of the PSBBN interface.
- PS2 games must be in ISO or ZSO format. PS1 games must be in VCD format
- PSBBN startup time increases when no active internet connection is available
- To quit PS1 games, press `L1 + SELECT + START`
- To quit PS2 games, press `L1 + L2 + R1 + R2 + SELECT + START`
- The `root` password for Linux is `password`. There is also a `ps2` user account with the password set as `password`

### Note on Retro GEM support:
If you have a Retro GEM, I would highly recommend that you install the [Retro GEM Game ID Resetter](https://github.com/CosmicScale/Retro-GEM-GameId-Resetter) on your PS2 Memory Card. With this app, when you quit a game, the Game ID is reset, and the Retro GEM settings are returned to global.

### Notes on Launch Disc:
**Launch Disc** loads the [Retro GEM Disc Launcher](https://github.com/CosmicScale/Retro-GEM-PS2-Disc-Launcher) application.

For physical PlayStation game discs:
- Sets the Retro GEM Game ID
- Adjusts the PlayStation driver's video mode, if needed, to ensure imports play in the correct mode

For physical PlayStation 2 game discs:
- Sets the Retro GEM Game ID
- Skips the PlayStation 2 logo check, allowing MechaPwn users to launch imports and master discs

Recommended usage:
- Add a shortcut for **Launch Disc** to the **Navigator Menu** if it is not there already
- Press `SELECT` to open the **Navigator Menu**
- Insert a game disc
- Select **Launch Disc** from the menu

### Notes on OPL:
- If OPL freezes at startup and games fail to launch from the PSBBN Game Channel, delete any existing OPL configuration files from your PS2 Memory Cards or connected USB devices.
- To display the games list in OPL, adjust the following settings:
  1. Settings > HDD (APA) Start Mode: Off
  2. Settings > BDM Start Mode: Auto
  3. Settings > BDM Devices > HDD (GPT/MBR): On
- Make sure a PS2 memory card is inserted, then select `Save Changes` from the main menu.

### If, after trying the above steps, games still do not appear in the OPL games list and fail to launch from the PSBBN Game Channel, your combination of SATA mod and drive may not be currently compatible with the exFAT version of OPL.

Possible solutions:
1. Wait for the OPL bug fix. You can learn more and report your issue [here](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader/issues/1437)
2. Connect the PS2 HDD/SSD directly to your PC using an internal SATA connection or a different USB adapter, then rerun the PSBBN installer
3. Try using a different HDD/SSD and rerun the PSBBN installer
4. Try using a different SATA mod for your PS2
5. Wait for the release of the PSBBN Neutrino Launcher

### Notes on APA-Jail:
APA-Jail, created and developed by [Berion](https://www.psx-place.com/resources/authors/berion.1431/), enables the PS2's APA partitions to coexist with an exFAT partition. This setup allows PSBBN to access the first 128 GB of the HDD/SSD directly. The remaining space on the drive is formatted as an exFAT partition, which can be accessed directly on a PC and on the PS2 by the [pre-release build of Open PS2 Loader](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader). PS2 games in the `ISO` or `ZSO` format are stored on the exFAT partition.

![APA-Jail Type-A](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1a29371-d0ff-431e-8b86-df8337ddf966)

An application called [OPL Launcher BDM](https://github.com/CosmicScale/OPL-Launcher-BDM) resides on the APA partitions, along with the [pre-release build of Open PS2 Loader](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader).
 
[OPL Launcher BDM](https://github.com/CosmicScale/OPL-Launcher-BDM) directs [Open PS2 Loader](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/Open-PS2-Loader) to launch specific PS2 games.

### Warning: Creating new partitions manually on your PS2 drive may lead to drive corruption.

## Installing the Japanese PSBBN software

There are a number of ways this can be achieved. On a Japanese PlayStation 2 console with an **official PSBBN installation disc**, or with **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3**.

To install via **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3** you will need a way to boot backup discs on your console, be that a mod chip or a swap disc. If you are lucky enough to have a **SCPH-500xx** series console you can use the **MechaPwn** softmod.

### Installing with Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3

**Preparations**
1. Download the **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3** ISO from the Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/details/sony-utility-disc-compilation-v3).
2. **SCPH-500xx consoles only**: Patch the ISO with the [Master Disc Patcher](https://www.psx-place.com/threads/playstation-2-master-disc-patcher-for-mechapwn.36547/).
3. Burn this ISO to a writable DVD. I recommend using [ImgBurn](https://www.imgburn.com).
4. **SCPH-500xx consoles only**: MechaPwn your PS2 console with the latest release candidate, currently [MechaPwn 3.0 Release Candidate 4 (RC4)](https://github.com/MechaResearch/MechaPwn/releases/tag/3.00-rc4). It is important that you use a version of MechaPwn that does not change the **Model Name** of your console or it will break compatibility with the Kloader app, we use later in this guide. Currently the latest stable version is not compatible. More details about exactly what MechaPwn does and how to use it can be found [here](https://github.com/MechaResearch/MechaPwn).
5. Format the PS2 HDD. In wLaunchELF press the `circle` button for **FileBrowser**, then select **MISC > HddManager**. Press `R1` to open the menu and select **Format**. When done, press `triangle` to exit.
6. Launch the **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3** DVD on your console. **SCPH-500xx consoles only:** Insert your newly burnt **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3** DVD into the DVD drive on your PS2 console. On the first screen of wLaunchELF, press the `circle` button for **FileBrowser**, then select **MISC > PS2Disc**. The DVD will launch. On all other model consoles, launch the **Sony Utility Discs Compilation 3** DVD any way you can (e.g. Mod chip/Swap disc).
7. After the disc loads, select **HDD Utility Discs > PlayStation BB Navigator Version 0.32** from the menu to begin the installation.

**Installation**  
There's an excellent guide [here](https://bungiefan.tripod.com/psbbninstall_01.html) that talks you through the Japanese install. Because we have already formatted the hard drive, during the install you will be presented with a [different screen](https://bungiefan.tripod.com/psbbninstall_02.html). It's important that you select the 3rd install option. This will install PSBBN without re-formatting the HDD. When the install is complete you will be instructed to remove the DVD, do so but also remove your Free McBoot Memory Card, before pressing the `circle` button.

**Network Settings**  
You will be asked to enter your network settings. Make sure your Ethernet cable is connected. Everything is still in Japanese, but it's relatively straightforward:
1. Press the `circle` button on the first screen.
2. On the next screen, select the **bottom** option, "Do not use PPPoE" and press `circle`.
3. On the next screen, select the **top** option, “Auto" for you IP address and press `circle`.
4. On the next screen, select the **top** option, “Auto” for DNS settings and press `circle`.
5. Press `right` on the d-pad to proceed to the next screen.
6. Select the **bottom** option, "Do not change router settings" and press `circle`.
7. Finally, press `circle` again to confirm your settings.

For your efforts you will be given a DNAS error. This is to be expected. We'll fix that next. Press `X` and feel free to explore your fresh install of the Japanese PSBBN.

**Disable DNAS Authentication**  
1. Turn off the console and put your Free McBoot Memory Card back into a memory card slot.  
2. Turn the console on and load wLaunchELF.  
3. Go to **FileBrowser**. Navigate to `hdd0:/__contents/bn.conf/` and delete the file `default_isp.dat`. This will disable the DNAS checks.

**Please Note**
Before installing the English patch, you **must** power off your console to standby mode by holding the reset button. Failure to do so will cause issues with Kloader.

## Notes
- Use OPL-Launcher to launch PS2 games from the Game Channel. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/OPL-Launcher).
- Lacks support for large HDDs so drives larger than 130 GB cannot be taken full advantage of. PSBBN can only see the first 130,999 MB of data on your HDD/SSD (as reported by wLaunchELF). If there is 131,000 MB or more on your HDD/SSD, PSBBN will fail to launch. Delete data so there is less than 131,000 MB used, and PSBBN will launch again. In that space, I've managed to install 40 PS2 games in the ZSO format, 9 PS1 games, all bootable from the Game Channel, plus 3 homebrew apps, and Linux. Be extra careful if you have installed via the [PS2 HDD RAW Image](#ps2-hdd-raw-image-install) on a drive larger than 120 GB, going over 130,999 MB will corrupt the drive.
- You might need to manually change the title of your "Favorite" folders if they were created before you [Patched an existing PSBBN install](#patch-an-existing-psbbn-install).

</details>

## Known Issues/Limitations of PSBBN
PSBBN only supports dates up to the end of 2030.  
A bug with Game Manuals randomly crashing when changing pages. Manuals only work reliably on the first 5 games installed.  
\* Instances in feega where some Japanese text could not be translated because it is hard coded in an encrypted file. Atok software has not been translated.  
\** Should also be compatible with the PS2 Slim SCPH-70xxx models with an IDE Resurrector or similar mod. [PSBBN Definitive English Patch 2.0](#new-to-version-20) and older versions of the [PS2 HDD RAW Image Install](#ps2-hdd-raw-image-install) are not compatible with early model Japanese PS2 consoles that have an external HDD due to space limitations. When [Patching an existing PSBBN install](#patch-an-existing-psbbn-install), Kloader might have compatibility issues with early model Japanese PS2 consoles.  
\***Default on-screen keyboard is Japanese. US English on-screen keyboard has been added, but you have to press `SELECT` a number of times to access it. I've noticed a bug where the spacebar key does not function on the US English on-screen keyboard. A space can be entered by pressing the triangle button on the controller instead. I could revert back to the Japanese qwerty keyboard in the future, but I think the benefits of the US keyboard outweigh this negative.
